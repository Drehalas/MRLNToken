# MRLN Token Project

MIN Token project is an ERC20 based vesting project.

# Specifications

### Project Overview

On software level, MRLN Token project is an ERC20 based vesting project. Given a tokenomics structure with Token Generation Events (TGE), cliff and vesting periods MRLN Vesting contract will allow the vested release of MRLN Token to defined addresses. These addresses will belong to project owners and will have different purposes. Two other contracts, MRLNPrivateSwap and MRLNStrategicSale will handle some amount of token sale defined in the tokenomics. Customers will be able to buy vested tokens from MRLNPrivateSwap at a set rate. When cliff ends and vesting period begins, customers should be able to release their tokens as they wish. MRLNStrategicSale will handle sales that project owners will make via legal agreements. These agreements will require the project owners to add the buyerâ€™s address and bought amount as beneficiary to the smart contract.
